## BLOCKCHAIN
##### WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?
The concept of “blockchain” became very discussable with the growing popularity of cryptocurrency. Someone believe that this technology can be a real breakthrough in the field of finance and secure databases. 
The simplest and most popular explanation is this: blockchain is a chain of blocks with information about transactions. Each block is connected with the previous one, as it contains hashed information about it. The entire blockchain is stored on the computer of each of its participants. 
For example, nowadays Bitcoin blockchain “weighs” more than 250 GB. All information on transferring cryptocurrency from wallet to wallet is stored on the blockchain. The history of all transactions can be traced, so extra bitcoin coins simply cannot appear from air by someone’s will.

##### WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN DIFFERENT FROM THE CLASSICAL DATABASE? 
The blockchain is stored on the computer of each network member, while the database is located on special servers that only certain organizations have access to.
Hacking such a database can have very bad consequences: attackers can transfer money to their accounts, destroy contracts, add confusion information to the data and damage certain parts of the storage. While blockchain is very hard to crack. Maybe sometimes it’s possible to replace information on several computers, but the security of all network will not be ok. Because the right information have all blockchain members on their computers. Everything will have to be broken, but in practice it is unrealistic and extremely labor intensive. To carry out such an operation, huge computer power will be required. 
So the blockchain gives many advantages to users of the system. Transaction participants cannot fool each other. It doesn’t need intermediaries like a bank for example. There is no central node in it, destroying which you can knock down all entire system. All operations are transparent to its participants since all data is entered into one database.

##### HOW IT WORKS? 
The basic blockchain system is an ever-growing sequence of blocks that are shared between participants using peer-to-peer networks, which most people use to download and distribute torrents.
A time stamp (hash sum) is added to each block, which is easiest to imagine as a unique fingerprint. These blocks are strictly in a certain order stacked in chains. If you try to rearrange the sequence of blocks, the system will reject the chain due to the mismatch of the structure and the hash sum.
So no one can change the time stamp and recalculate the hash amount that is correct from the point of view of the system, the blockchain uses several methods of protection: Proof of Work (PoW, proof of work) and Proof of Stake (PoS, proof of ownership).

##### WHAT IS A SMART CONTRACT?
A smart contract is a condition written in computer language, under which the parties signing a smart contract exchange any assets: currency, real estate, stocks, etc. For example, the buyer’s currency is transferred to the program and frozen there until he seller fulfills his part of the contract. If the condition is broken, the amount is returned to the client’s account, and the smart contract is canceled. If all conditions are met, then an exchange of assets occurs.
This exchange is recorded in the smart contract and recorded on the blockchain, after which it will not be possible to cancel, replace or destroy it. The program is engaged in tracking the fulfilled conditions in an automatic mode, control or participation of people is not needed. In other words, smart contracts work directly between stakeholders, excluding any third unnecessary parties.

##### WHERE HAS THE IDEA OF A SMART CONTRACT HAPPENED?
Back in 1996, the first idea about smart contracts was expressed by Nick Szabo, a scientist with developments in computer science and cryptography. But to realize this in practice was possible only in 2008, when the principles of smart contracts found application in the Bitcoin blockchain. 

##### WHAT DISADVANTAGES HAVE BLOCKCHAIN AND SMART CONTRACT?
Of course, all technologies have their disadvantages and blockchain is not an exception.
1. Big power use.
2. Cost.
3. Uncertain regulatoty status.

##### WHAT MAKES SMART CONTRACTS PERSPECTIVE?
The range of their application can be extremely wide. The benefits vary depending on the specific types and patterns of smart contracts. But there are several main advantages that make such systems promising. 
Smart contracts relieve intermediaries between interested parties: the costs of services will be really reduced, and transaction times will be much faster. The fewer pads between people and companies willing to exchange assets, the faster their contracts will be executed. The main thing is to clearly translate all the terms of the contract into a program form and provide the program with access to all the necessary data.
Reduction of material costs (for example for powerful servers), expensive storage complexes.
Lose the monopoly of large companies trying to manipulate the market of big capital.
In addition, smart contracts in a distributed blockchain registry cannot be changed, replaced or destroyed. If suddenly one of the parties wants to change the blockchain, it will not be able.
Optimists predict release from corruption, the exclusion of monetary fraud and other financial crimes. In their opinion, the transparency of the system will force all its users to comply with the law, because any operation is open.
